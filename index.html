             <p> 
                 I heard Paris was the most beautiful city in the world, I guess it is true. I really encourage evry one to take a tour of this incredible city at least once in his lifetime.

             <p> 
             The mountain is for me an inspiration, that's why most of my hobbies are taking place in this rude environment. I practice often rock climbing, mountaineering, trekking, VTT downhill, trailing, skiing, ice climbing and many others. This only place feed my soul with peace and good energy.

             Rocky is a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, who was born the 6th June 2020. He is the best friend everybody could hope to meet someday. Energy and love are the two words that define me.
